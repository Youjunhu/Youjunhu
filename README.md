- 👋 Hi, I’m @Youjunhu working on computational tokamak plasma physics.
- 👀 I’m interested in machine learning, numerical methods, programming, and data visulization.
- 🌱 I’m currently developing gyrokinetic elctromagnetic PIC code for tokamak plasma turbulence simulation.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaboration on integrated modeling of tokamak plasma.
